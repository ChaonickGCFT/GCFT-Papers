## 📖 Abstract

This repository contains the full paper and LaTeX source for **Reconstructing the Standard Model via GCFT**, a comprehensive theoretical framework unifying particles, forces, and spacetime as phase structures in a single continuous coherence field \(\Xi\).

It presents a coherent alternative to the Standard Model and ΛCDM cosmology, where mass, charge, spin, gravity, and redshift all emerge from topological phase dynamics of the coherence field.
