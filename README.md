# General Coherence Field Theory (GCFT) Papers

Welcome to the collection of research papers on the **General Coherence Field Theory (GCFT)** — a unified physics framework proposing that all particles, forces, and spacetime phenomena emerge from a single continuous coherence field \(\Xi\).

## Included Papers

- **Reconstructing the Standard Model via GCFT**  
  A detailed theoretical reconstruction of the Standard Model particles and interactions as phase-locked resonance structures within the \(\Xi\)-field.

- **Coherence Field Cosmology: Replacing \(\Lambda\)CDM with a Single Coherence Field (\(\Xi\))**  
  Presents a cosmological model based on the GCFT framework, offering alternatives to dark matter and dark energy concepts.

## About GCFT

GCFT is an ontological and physical theory where:

- **Mass** arises from local compression of coherence quanta (“luxions”).
- **Charge** is a topological winding number of the coherence phase.
- **Spin** corresponds to vortex handedness in phase topology.
- **Gravity** emerges as gradients of coherence compression — no graviton needed.
- **Quantum mechanics and cosmology** are unified via continuous field coherence dynamics.
