\section{Abstract}

I present a complete reconstruction of the Standard Model using General Coherence Field Theory (GCFT), a framework in which all particles emerge as resonant configurations of a single continuous field, $\Xi$. In this formulation, leptons, baryons, mesons, and bosons arise not as quantized point objects or excitations of separate fields, but as structured phase phenomenaâ€”stable or metastable $\Xi$-configurations shaped by curvature, compression, and coherence gradients. GCFT eliminates particle dualism, virtual exchange, and force mediation by modeling all interactions as phase transitions within $\Xi$. We derive the known particle families from topological recursion, coherence retention thresholds, and field deformation pathways, showing how charge, spin, and mass emerge from intrinsic field dynamics. A coherence-based field table replaces the traditional Standard Model chart. GCFT has successfully predicted and matched observational signatures including pre-decoherence $\Xi$-chirps and apparent mass-gap violations in gravitational wave data (e.g., GW231123), offering a falsifiable, unified alternative to gauge-based quantum field theory.
