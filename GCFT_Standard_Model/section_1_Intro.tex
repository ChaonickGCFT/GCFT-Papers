\section{Introduction}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics classifies all known fundamental particles—leptons, quarks, gauge bosons, and the Higgs—and describes their interactions via quantum field theory (QFT) grounded in gauge symmetry and force mediation. Despite its success, the SM excludes gravity, cannot explain dark matter or dark energy, and derives particle masses from symmetry-breaking insertions rather than first principles~\cite{Smolin2006}.

General Coherence Field Theory (GCFT)~\cite{Hacquier2025a, Hacquier2025b} offers a unified alternative. In GCFT, there are no particles in the conventional sense. All apparent matter and radiation emerge as resonance structures within a single universal field, the coherence field~$\Xi$. Mass, charge, and spin arise from field compression, torsion, and phase topology, while gravity and forces emerge from coherence gradients—not from mediator particles.

GCFT has already made falsifiable predictions absent in GR and QM. It explains Earth flyby anomalies via phase drift in the $\Xi$-clock~\cite{Anderson2008, Hacquier2025a}, and predicts pre-merger coherence chirps in black hole systems—the ``$\Xi$-chirp''—both now observed in Doppler and gravitational wave data~\cite{Hacquier2025c}.

Unlike multiverse or string theory approaches, GCFT is directly falsifiable through measurable field behavior and resonance transitions~\cite{Popper1959, Tegmark2007}.

This paper reconstructs the SM using GCFT. Leptons, baryons, mesons, and bosons are shown to arise from topological and energetic structures in~$\Xi$, replacing the traditional field chart with a coherence-mode field table (see Table~\ref{tab:coherence_field_table}).
