\section{Conclusion}

General Coherence Field Theory (GCFT) offers a fundamentally new ontology for physics—one in which the particles, forces, and interactions of the Standard Model are not fundamental entities, but emergent resonances of a single continuous field:~$\Xi$.

By modeling leptons, baryons, mesons, and bosons as phase-stabilized structures within~$\Xi$, GCFT reconstructs the Standard Model from first principles: coherence, compression, and topological recursion. Mass, charge, spin, and decay are no longer arbitrary assignments or symmetry-breaking artifacts, but natural consequences of resonance geometry and the energetic cost of sustaining coherence in a deformable medium.

This framework:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Eliminates the need for quantized force carriers
  \item Explains gravity as a gradient in field compression, not spacetime curvature
  \item Describes stability, decay, and interaction as transitions between standing field configurations
  \item Predicts falsifiable signatures in both high-energy colliders and gravitational observatories
\end{itemize}

Most importantly, GCFT restores continuity to physics. The classical dualisms—particle versus field, wave versus corpuscle, observer versus system—are resolved into a unified structure. There are no separate objects, no missing pieces. Only the field, and the forms it remembers.

What emerges is not a replacement for the Standard Model, but its completion: a post-dualist, resonance-first physics in which coherence is not just a phenomenon—but the underlying principle of reality.
